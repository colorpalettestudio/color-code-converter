Awesome—here’s a drop-in HTML block you can paste above your app container.
It’s pure static HTML (no JS), so Google/AdSense will “see” it as publisher content.
It also includes a valid FAQ schema that should clear the “invalid items” warning.

✅ Tip: Keep only one <h1> on the page. If your app already prints an H1, change the one below to <h2>.

  <h2 id="converter-faq">Color Code Converter: FAQ</h2>

  <h3>What formats does this converter support?</h3>
  <p>HEX, RGB, HSL, and CMYK. Paste any of these and the others populate instantly.</p>

  <h3>How accurate are the conversions, especially CMYK?</h3>
  <p>
    RGB/HEX/HSL conversions are exact within floating-point rounding. CMYK depends on print profiles;
    this tool uses a common formula suitable for general reference. Always proof with your printer’s ICC profile for final print work.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I export or share my results?</h3>
  <p>Yes—copy any value in one click or export a quick reference as PNG/PDF.</p>

  <h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
  <p>No. The converter is free and works without sign-up.</p>

Where to place it

Paste it above your app’s root element (the <div> your React/Vue/Svelte mounts into).

Don’t hide it in accordions—keep it visible.

Keep only one FAQ schema block on the page to avoid conflicts.
